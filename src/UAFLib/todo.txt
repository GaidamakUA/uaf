- Ranged combat
- implement a simple spell like magic missile
- Design an API for a wrapper that would simplify the combat rounds.  Then build it.
- TestCombatMovementAttack.js - 2 test case for Guarding-CanGuardAttack could be a little better - maybe after the status is set, the UpdateCombat() or HandleTimeDelayMsgBegin() gets called to let the guarder attack
- Take a look at the CombatPlacement / MonsterPlacement special ability.  See if we can get that to be used in the way it was intended
- Make a monster library loader, class library loader, etc.
- Test case(s) for inventory management of Joinable items
- go back through the C++ source and find all instances of "delete" and re-insert them back with calls to a MemoryManager() class.  Apparently jint responds to delete statements, although all engines might not
