- Make the status frame on the combat scene!
- Make a unit test that sets an enemy next to a character and makes an attack - check out makeAttack called from COMBATANT.HandleTimeDelayMsgBegin (ew)
- Figure out how we are going to load resources in Unity.  Make a ResourceLoader interface in UAFLib that a Unity class will implement
- Make a monster library loader, class library loader, etc.
- Figure out how to handle their compression algorithm
- go back through the C++ source and find all instances of "delete" and re-insert them back with calls to a MemoryManager() class.  Apparently jint responds to delete statements, although all engines might not
- Get GenerateIndoorCombatMap() working
