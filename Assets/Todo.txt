- Reduce startup time - seems like this is mostly the specab loading code - try packaging all .js together into a single file and see if that makes it faster - use timestamps in Unity to measure
- Support diagonal moves
- rename icon_PC_Fighter_Male_# sprite
- Ranged attacks
- Possible bug: randomizeAndPlaceMonsters could put two monsters in the same spot - check to see if the mosnterLocations.Get() is already set before using it
- Dungeon Generation
- Treasure chests!
- Moving animations on player RigidBody
- Comment the living hell out of everything
- Leveling up - start at CHARACTER.prototype.GetLevelCap
- Move the window with the player smoothly when they get outiside of a certain box in the middle - e.g. x > 306 or x < 118.  Use Lerp.  See code in MainCameraEvents
- Visit the shop(s?)!!!
- Fog of war
