- Player is stuck after opening treasure chest - probably the playerModelMove(0,0) hack after returning from inventory screen
- One of the test cases is failing - "value is null"
- MacOS build does nothing much - try building on a Linux VM
- Reduce startup time - It is mostly happening in the item library - I cut off a second by using the protobuf serialization routine, but a lot of time is being taken in ITEM_DATA_TYPE.LoadFromLoader - try moving itemData into the C# scope and loading it there and returning it to the engine.  Will have to deal with ExpandoObject
- Possible bug: randomizeAndPlaceMonsters could put two monsters in the same spot - check to see if the mosnterLocations.Get() is already set before using it - Also they can spawn in the same place as the player!
- Support diagonal moves
- CombatMenuHandler and InventoryMenuHandler should inherit from a base class to limit code duplication
- Really need to refactor UserInputEvents and InventorySceneEvents to tie into the CombatMenuHandler/InventoryMenuHandler - having two points of processing for the keystrokes is confusing and really they should mostly be tied together with the one exception of the Movement keys
- rename icon_PC_Fighter_Male_# sprite
- Ranged attacks
- Dungeon Generation
- Moving animations on player RigidBody
- Comment the living hell out of everything
- Leveling up - start at CHARACTER.prototype.GetLevelCap
- Move the window with the player smoothly when they get outiside of a certain box in the middle - e.g. x > 306 or x < 118.  Use Lerp.  See code in MainCameraEvents
- Visit the shop(s?)!!!
- Fog of war
